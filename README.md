# StoryWriter

**StoryWriter** is a multi-agent framework for generating high-quality **long stories** with logical coherence and engaging plots—two major challenges that remain unsolved for most current large language models (LLMs).

## ✨ Highlights

Long story generation is hard due to:

1. **Discourse Coherence**
   Maintaining consistency, logic, and completeness throughout the story.

2. **Narrative Complexity**
   Crafting engaging, interwoven plots across characters and events.

To tackle these, we introduce **`StoryWriter`**, a **multi-agent story generation framework** with the following components:

* **🧠 Outline Agent**
  Produces event-based outlines rich in plots, characters, and inter-event relationships.

* **🗂️ Planning Agent**
  Breaks down the outline into chapter-wise plans, ensuring an engaging, interwoven narrative.

* **✍️ Writing Agent**
  Dynamically compresses the story history to generate coherent new content aligned with the current event.
